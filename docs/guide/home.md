# Introduction

A high-performance, distributed, lightweight DDoS mitigation and scrubbing program.

## ⛩️?

⛩️（鳥居（とりい））is a structure built at the entrance of Japanese shrines, symbolizing a sacred boundary that blocks the intrusion of evil.

Server Torii is like a Torii gate for the digital world, quietly standing guard in front of your server. 🛡️⛩️

## Environment Requirements

Server Torii was developed based on the following environment:
- Nginx 1.28.0
- Go 1.24.0

Technically, Server Torii is compatible with the following environments:
- Nginx 1.10 and above
- Go 1.21.0 and above (Generally, Go after this version will automatically install the correct version of the toolchain.)
