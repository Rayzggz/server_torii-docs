For IP/URL Allowlists and Blocklists, keep the configuration file empty. For HTTP FLOOD Attack Mitigation, as it uses a segmented circular counter, you can set a very large request limit and a very small time interval to effectively disable HTTP FLOOD mitigation. For example, 100000/1s. For Crawlers Verification, set it to false.</p>',9)]))}]]),r=JSON.parse('{"path":"/guide/faq.html","title":"Frequently Asked Questions","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"How to start/restart/stop the service?","slug":"how-to-start-restart-stop-the-service","link":"#how-to-start-restart-stop-the-service","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"How to modify the configuration at runtime?","slug":"how-to-modify-the-configuration-at-runtime","link":"#how-to-modify-the-configuration-at-runtime","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"How to disable a specific feature?","slug":"how-to-disable-a-specific-feature","link":"#how-to-disable-a-specific-feature","children":[]}],"git":{"updatedTime":1746640384000,"contributors":[{"name":"Roi Feng","username":"","email":"me@roi.moe","commits":1}],"changelog":[{"hash":"2b8f7dd48939069b03d4bb6990df65c14a3427e9","time":1746640384000,"email":"me@roi.moe","author":"Roi Feng","message":"docs: faq"}]},"filePathRelative":"guide/faq.md"}')}}]);
